Find Matching Sequences

Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".


Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
Example 2:

Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= words.length <= 5000
1 <= words[i].length <= 50
s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.



Approach #2: Next Letter Pointers [Accepted]
Intuition

Use an array heads of length 26, one entry for each letter of the alphabet. For each letter in S, we'll take all the words waiting for that letter, and have them wait for the next letter in that word. If we use the last letter of some word, it adds 1 to the answer.

I go through S once, and while I'm doing that, I move through all words accordingly. That is, I keep track of how much of each word I've already seen, and with each letter of S, I advance the words waiting for that letter. To quickly find the words waiting for a certain letter, I store each word (and its progress) in a list of words waiting for that letter. Then for each of the lucky words whose current letter just occurred in S, I update their progress and store them in the list for their next letter.

Let's go through the given example:

S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
I store that "a", "acd" and "ace" are waiting for an 'a' and "bb" is waiting for a 'b' (using parentheses to show how far I am in each word):

'a':  ["(a)", "(a)cd", "(a)ce"]
'b':  ["(b)b"]
Then I go through S. First I see 'a', so I take the list of words waiting for 'a' and store them as waiting under their next letter:

'b':  ["(b)b"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
You see "a" is already waiting for nothing anymore, while "acd" and "ace" are now waiting for 'c'. Next I see 'b' and update accordingly:

'b':  ["b(b)"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
Then 'c':

'b':  ["b(b)"]
'd':  ["ac(d)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a"]
Then 'd':

'b':  ["b(b)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a", "acd"]
Then 'e':

'b':  ["b(b)"]
None: ["a", "acd", "ace"]
And now I just return how many words aren't waiting for anything anymore.
